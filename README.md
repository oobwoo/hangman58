## milestone_2 
milestone_2 first of the practical, in this milestone we create a random list of words for a user to be able to see if their letter is in the word of from a list of words. It uses the random module to be able to use the random.choice function so that a random word is chosen from the assigned word list. User input is added for the user to select a random letter. In the last task code is added to ensure that the user's input is a alphabetic character and only one character was inputted.
